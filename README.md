# Final-Project-for-Scripting
My final project for scripting which fetches a specific APOD API picture from Nasa's Astronomy Picture of the Day API using a given date and sets it as the Desktop Background. It also comes with a GUI which allows you to set the APOD date from a stored database of date images. I am working on the GUI right now, but it is really difficult!
